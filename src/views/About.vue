            <p>My name's <b>Mikita Volakh</b>.</p>
            <p>I am a <b>3rd year BSc Computer Science student</b> at <a href="https://vu.nl/en">Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam</a> 
              taking <a href="https://vu.nl/en/education/minor/deep-programming/curriculum">Deep Programming minor</a>.
              The expected graduation date is in November 2023.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>During my time at VU I had experience with a lot of programming languages including: 
            <span v-for="(val,key) of langs">{{ val }}<span v-if="key != Object.keys(langs).length - 1">, </span></span>.
            As multiple courses were focussed on low-level programming, C and C++ have been the most used programming languages so far.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Throughout my studies I took a bunch of courses, among which the most notable are: 
              <span v-for="(val,key) of courses">{{ val }}<span v-if="key != Object.keys(courses).length - 1">, </span></span> and more...
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>If you're wondering how I got into programming â€” I have been a gamer my entire life. It all started with going through game 
              files and configs, then I started writing/modyfying mods for some of the games I played.
              Then the passion for computer games slowly disappeared, which is when I actually started programming. That was about the same
              time I went to obtain my Bachelor's in CS.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Now, I'm primarily focussed on learning different technologies related to web developement, but mostly:
              <span v-for="(val,key) of technologies">{{ val.name }}<span v-if="key == Object.keys(technologies).length - 2"> and </span>
                <span v-if="key != Object.keys(technologies).length - 1 && key != Object.keys(technologies).length - 2">, </span></span>.
              I also love creating QoL game mods, usually in C# for those games written in Unity. Unity is another technology that really attracts me.
              Hopefully, one day I'll give game development a shot.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>I'm currently looking for an <b>Internship/Junior Fullstack/Backend</b> position.</p>
